* This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
* What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

#### Task 3 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
Provided dataset: 'Iris.csv'

* Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

#### Task 5 - To Explore Business Analytics 
Provided dataset: ‘SampleSuperstore.csv’

* As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
